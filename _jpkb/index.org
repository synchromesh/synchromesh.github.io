* Welcome!
  This is my personal wiki. I am a programmer and musician, husband
  and father currently living in Norfolk, England. I can also be found
  on [[https://www.facebook.com/synchromesh][Facebook]], [[https://twitter.com/synchromesh][Twitter]], [[https://www.google.com/+JohnPallisterSynchromesh][Google+]] and the [[http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4385][Muff Wiggler forum]].

* News & updates
  - *2015-11-06 Fri* ::
       I'm creating a new version of my [[https://johnp.net/jpkb/][personal wiki site]] using
       [[https://github.com/octopress/octopress][Octopress 3]], to be hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][GitHub Pages]]. Using various
       plugins, I can write everything in [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] using [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

       For the time being, the [[https://johnp.net/jpkb/][original JPKB Trac site]] remains.

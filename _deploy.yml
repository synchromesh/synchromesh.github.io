# _deploy.yml - Octopress deployment settings for my blog.
# File Created: 3 November 2015
#
# The blog is published as a "user/organisation page" rather than a
# "project" (unlike the JPKB Gollum wiki, which will be a project).
#

method: git                               # How do you want to deploy? git, rsync or s3.
